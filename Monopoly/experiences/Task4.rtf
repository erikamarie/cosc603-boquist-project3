\f0\fs24 \cf0 Task 4- Modifying a JUnit Test Case\
\
JUnit responded to the change from TYPE_CHANCE to TYPE_CC very elegantly. All the tests were run with the failure marked in the CardsTest drop down. The failure trace showed there was an assertion failed error with the number of assertions expected as 2, but the results were 1. \
It also showed that there was a failure trace to the testCardType method. }
