\f0\fs24 \cf0 Task8- Refactoring: Extracting a Method from Code\
\
This task I found to be very useful! I know I'm definitely guilty of having methods that are too long, which is a bad design smell.\
For extracting the calculateMonopoliesRent method I chose the second option, in which the parameter was the integer of rentToCharge, and the array of strings was created within the new method. I chose to proceed this way because the getRent method already created a new object and performed an operation, so I thought it to be a good idea to create this new object and perform the for loop operation both in the extracted method.}
